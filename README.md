## Abstract

Efficient Convolution via HW/SW level Parallelism

- [Project for CS61C](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp23/projects/proj4/) - "Software Engineering" at UC Berkeley during Spring 2023.
-  Utilizes SIMD instructions and OpenMP to achieve speedup of 8.05x compared to the serial implementation. 
-  Integration of Open MPI enables parallel computing across multiple processes or nodes, leading to a speedup of around 5.30x compared to the serial implementation.

The combined effect of SIMD instructions and MPI results in significant performance enhancements for the matrix convolution task, demonstrating the benefits of parallelization and utilizing hardware-level optimizations
